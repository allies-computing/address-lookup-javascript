# Address lookup with JavaScript
Simple demo to search for addresses via the Postcoder API on form submit and returns the full address.

This example can be used to return address results in either a `<select>` element, or as a list of radio buttons. To change to using radio buttons, simply comment out the first `<script>` element at the bottom of `index.html` and uncomment the second.
